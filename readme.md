### Why I made this?
I wanted to recreate a chatbot based off ChatGPT without all the fancy stuff, which means this is a hard coded javascript chat bot. It only answers specific questions, but can detect varied versions of those questions, like for greetings, you could say Hello, Hey, Hi, Heya, Heyo and get a gretting response, but saying Hola would cause it to not work.

### Possible questions the bot can answer

* ~~Can you solve NumxNum~~ (I guess I didn't finish this)
* can you write a hello word function in javascript? (Case sensitive)
* Hello
* can you generate an image? (Case sensitive)
